# Combat & Death Reference

## Combat Philosophy

Combat is **dramatic and consequential**, not tactical simulation. Every fight should:
- Have stakes beyond "win or lose"
- Reveal character — how do they fight? What lines won't they cross?
- Create consequences — injuries, reputation, collateral damage
- Allow multiple resolution paths — fight, flee, negotiate, deceive

---

## Initiative

**Cinematic Initiative** — no strict turn order:

1. **Ambush/Surprise:** Attacker acts first, defender reacts
2. **Contested Start:** Both roll, higher acts first
3. **Chaotic Melee:** Narrate fluid exchanges, ask "What do you do?" at decision points

Combat flows based on narrative logic. NPCs and player interweave naturally.

## Action Economy

Per exchange (not per turn):

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Major** | Primary action | Attack, cast, complex maneuver |
| **Minor** | Quick action | Move, draw weapon, interact |
| **Reaction** | Defensive response (costs next minor) | Dodge, parry, counter |
| **Free** | No cost | Speak briefly, drop item, observe |

**Rule of Cool:** If it's dramatic and makes sense, allow it. Don't count squares.

## Damage & Conditions

### Status Track

| Status | Description | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Fresh** | Unharmed | No penalties |
| **Wounded** | Taken hits, bleeding | -2 to physical rolls |
| **Critical** | Serious injury | -4 to all rolls, risk of collapse |
| **Down** | Incapacitated | Cannot act, bleeding out |
| **Dead** | Gone | See Death section |

### Conditions

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Stunned** | Lose next action |
| **Bleeding** | Worsens each exchange until treated |
| **Pinned** | Cannot move, disadvantage on attacks |
| **Terrified** | Must flee or freeze, -4 to attacks |
| **Enraged** | +2 damage, -2 defense, cannot retreat |

**Track narrative status, not HP numbers.** "You're wounded and bleeding from the shoulder."

## Combat Resolution

**Attack Roll:** D20 + relevant modifier vs. target difficulty

| Difficulty | DC | Description |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| Easy | 8 | Unaware, restrained |
| Normal | 12 | Alert combatant |
| Hard | 16 | Skilled fighter, good cover |
| Extreme | 20 | Elite, heavily armored, fortified |

**Damage Escalation:**

| Margin | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Beat DC by 0-3 | Glancing — minor wound, no status change |
| Beat DC by 4-7 | Solid — worsen by one status level |
| Beat DC by 8+ | Devastating — worsen by two levels, possible condition |
| Nat 20 | Maximum effect + bonus (disarm, stun, etc.) |

## Companion Combat

NPCs fight **autonomously**:
- They have their own combat style and preferences
- They may refuse orders that contradict their nature
- They protect themselves and their interests
- Track their status separately

**NPC-NPC relationships affect combat:**
- Allies coordinate and cover each other
- Feuding companions may not cover each other
- Injured companions may retreat without orders
- High-trust companions take risks for each other

## Environmental Combat

- **Cover:** +2 to +6 defense depending on quality
- **Height advantage:** +2 to ranged attacks
- **Hazards** (fire, acid, falls): automatic damage
- **Darkness:** -4 to attacks unless adapted
- **Destructible environment:** supports collapse, vehicles explode — narrate collateral for consequence tracking

## Death & Failure

### Death Philosophy

Death is **meaningful but not arbitrary**. The player invests deeply in their character — losing them must be dramatic, not random. But stakes must be real, or tension dies.

### Death Spiral

When a character reaches **Down**:
1. **Bleeding Out:** 3 exchanges to stabilize or die
2. **Ally Intervention:** Another character can attempt stabilization (DC 14)
3. **Self-Stabilization:** If alone, DC 18 (disadvantage if Critical before Down)
4. **Dramatic Last Words:** If stabilization fails, player gets a final moment

### When the PC Can Die

- Reaches Down and no stabilization in 3 exchanges
- Chooses a sacrifice play with known fatal risk and fails
- Betrayed by trusted NPC with lethal intent
- Player executes a plan with known fatal risk

### When the PC Survives

- Random encounter goes badly → captured instead
- First session → establish the character first
- Death would feel arbitrary or unsatisfying

### Last Stand

When death is imminent and **chosen** by the player:
1. **One final action** with automatic success (no roll)
2. **Dramatic monologue** if desired
3. **Guaranteed impact** — their sacrifice accomplishes something meaningful
4. **Legacy effect** — world remembers, companions permanently affected

### Alternative Failures

Often more interesting than death:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Capture** | Taken prisoner | Wake in enemy cell, gear confiscated |
| **Maiming** | Permanent injury | Lose an eye, chronic pain |
| **Debt** | Owe dangerous faction | Rescued by mob, now indebted |
| **Loss** | Companion dies instead | NPC takes the bullet meant for you |
| **Corruption** | Forced compromise | Betray a principle to survive |
| **Reputation** | Known as failure | Street cred destroyed, contacts cold |

### Companion Death

Companions are **not plot-armored**:
- Their deaths create massive consequence ripples
- Player actions (or inaction) can cause companion death
- Warning signs should exist but can be missed
- NPC's own agenda can lead them into fatal situations

### Resurrection & Return

**Default:** Death is permanent.

**If universe allows** (Altered Carbon, certain fantasy):
- Return has significant cost (financial, psychological, spiritual)
- Character is changed (memories lost, personality shifted)
- Not a reset button — death still mattered

## Encounter Generation

### Quick Encounter Formula

1. **Roll or choose threat type:**
   - 1-2: Combat — hostile forces, creatures, rivals
   - 3-4: Social — NPC with agenda, negotiation, information
   - 5: Environmental — hazard, obstacle, resource
   - 6: Mystery — clue, anomaly, discovery

2. **Connect to existing threads** — can this involve a pending consequence? An established NPC?

3. **Add an NPC with an agenda** — even "random" encounters have someone who wants something

4. **Offer 2+ approaches** — never just "fight or die"

### Encounter Seeds

**Urban/Cyberpunk:**

| D6 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | Gang shakedown — they want something specific |
| 2 | Corporate agent "requests" a meeting |
| 3 | Old contact needs help or offers a job |
| 4 | Law enforcement checkpoint — what are you carrying? |
| 5 | Environmental hazard — toxic spill, collapse |
| 6 | Witness to crime — do you intervene? |

**Dark Fantasy:**

| D6 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | Monster ambush — but why is it here? |
| 2 | Travelers hiding a secret |
| 3 | Religious procession — join, avoid, or confront? |
| 4 | Merchant with rare item — the price isn't money |
| 5 | Weather forces shelter |
| 6 | Ruins with signs of recent activity |

**Horror/Urban Fantasy:**

| D6 | Encounter |
|----|-----------|
| 1 | Something follows — glimpsed, never clear |
| 2 | Innocent asks for help — trap or genuine? |
| 3 | Territory boundary — you've crossed into someone's domain |
| 4 | Supernatural manifestation — the veil is thin |
| 5 | Hunter becomes hunted — someone's tracking you |
| 6 | Ally contact gone wrong — they're compromised |
